Hello! Let me introduce myself: I'm Bruno, a Brazilian Engineer who is passionate about *learning* and *teaching*. I've started this project as a challenge to myself to improve my programming skylls. 

All the solutions to the problems have been created using a combo of Jupyter notebooks + Jekyll. You'll find a Disqus chat at the end of each post. Feel free to reach me, and other people, there!

If you would like to contact me, feel free to visit:

Thanks!
