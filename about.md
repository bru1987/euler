Hey! 

I'm Bruno, a Brazilian Engineer who is passionate about *learning* and *teaching*. I've started this project as a challenge to improve my programming skills. 

All the solutions to the problems have been created using a combo of [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) + [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). You'll find a [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) chat at the end of each post. Feel free to reach me there.

If you would like to know more about me, make sure you visit:

Thank you!
