Some explanation here.


```python
# Function that adds the first n primes
def primes_sum(n):
    # We'll start with the values 2 and 3 already inserted on the sum
    summation = 2
    candidate = 3 # current possible prime being analysed
    
    while (candidate < n):
        for divisor in range (2,(round(candidate**0.5)+1)):
            if (candidate % divisor == 0):
                candidate += 1
                break
            elif ((candidate % divisor != 0) & (divisor + 1 == (round(candidate**0.5)+1))):
                print ('candidate = ',candidate)
                summation += candidate
                print('summation = ',summation)
                candidate += 1
                
    return summation
```


```python
primes_sum(10)
```

    candidate =  3
    summation =  5
    candidate =  5
    summation =  10
    candidate =  7
    summation =  17





    17



It seems to be working just fine. Let's tewak it a little bit and test whether runtime will be an issue.


```python
import time
# Function that adds the first n primes
def primes_sum(n):
    start = time.time()
    # We'll start with the values 2 and 3 already inserted on the sum
    summation = 2
    candidate = 3 # current possible prime being analysed
    
    while (candidate < n):
        for divisor in range (2,(round(candidate**0.5)+1)):
            if (candidate % divisor == 0):
                candidate += 1
                break
            elif ((candidate % divisor != 0) & (divisor + 1 == (round(candidate**0.5)+1))):
                summation += candidate
                candidate += 1

    elapsed = time.time() - start
    print ("Elapsed time: ", elapsed, "s")
    return summation
```


```python
primes_sum(20000) #100 times smaller than the actual number
```

    Elapsed time:  0.1121058464050293 s





    21171191



Therefore it will take approximately 100 times that time, which is fine.


```python
primes_sum(2000000)
```

    Elapsed time:  65.05433702468872 s





    142913828922



It took a minute. Not bad
