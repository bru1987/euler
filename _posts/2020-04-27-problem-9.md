It may be the case that the algorithm shows more than the number asked - that is because there could be more than one triple whose c is the one XXX.


```python
n = 500 # number of triplets shown

def first_n_triples(n):
    i = 1 # counter of triplets
    c = 1 # c^2  = a^2 + b^2
    list_of_triples = []

    while i <= n:
        b = c-1
        while b > 1:
            a = b-1
            while a > 1:
                if (c**2 == a**2 + b**2):
                    list_of_triples.append([c, b, a])
                    i += 1
                a -= 1
            b -= 1
        c += 1    
    return list_of_triples
```


```python
list = first_n_triples(n)
```

Here are the first 5 triples...


```python
list[0:5]
```




    [[5, 4, 3], [10, 8, 6], [13, 12, 5], [15, 12, 9], [17, 15, 8]]



and the last five in order to not make this post so looooong. We can verify by the last triples found that the triple whose sum adds up to 1000 is in the middle of our setXXX.


```python
list[n-5:n]
```




    [[615, 600, 135],
     [615, 561, 252],
     [615, 492, 369],
     [615, 468, 399],
     [617, 608, 105]]



One of these triples has a sum equal to 1000. Let's find it. We'll run through each XXsublistXX until we find one that gives us a sum which is 1000. After that, We'll show it. On a later step, we'll calculate their product.


```python
sum = 30
i = 1

while i < n:
    if (list[i][0]+list[i][1]+list[i][2]) == sum:
        print(list[i])
        break
    i += 1
```

    [13, 12, 5]



```python
list[i][0]*list[i][1]*list[i][2]
```




    780




```python
sum = 1000
i = 1

while i < n:
    if (list[i][0]+list[i][1]+list[i][2]) == sum:
        print(list[i])
        break
    i += 1
```

    [425, 375, 200]



```python
list[i][0]*list[i][1]*list[i][2]
```




    31875000



As usual, my algorithm took ages to run. I am not good with optimizing run time.
