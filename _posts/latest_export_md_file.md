## Problem #2

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Solution #1

First of all, the fibonnaci series actually starts at 1 and the second number is also 1. The correct Fibonacci series is 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 and so on. But let’s ignore that for the sake of keeping the original exercise untouched.

Using brute force, we can implement the solution shown on [this](www.google.com) flowchart.


```python
import time

def solution_1(n):
    start = time.time()
    # the three numbers of the sequence in a row will be a1, a2 and a3
    # let's consider this special type of Fibonacci sequence that starts with 1,2,3,...
    a1 = 1
    a2 = 2
    a3 = a1+a2

    # here we start the sum with the first even term, 2
    sum = a2

    while a3 < n:
            if a3 % 2 == 0:
                sum += a3
                
            a1 = a2
            a2 = a3
            a3 = a1+a2

    elapsed = time.time() - start
    print(sum, elapsed)
    
    return
    
solution_1(4000000)
```

### Solution #2

A different, more elegant approach would be to realize that, in a Fibonacci sequence, the even and odd numbers appear on the following fasion:

odd, odd, even, odd, odd, even, odd, odd, even,…

In other words, for each three numbers in the sequence, one of them is even.

Let’s not forget, nevertheless, that we do not have a true, legitimate Fibonacci sequence in this problem. On this case, we have odd, even, odd, odd, even, odd, odd, even and so on.

So let’s implement our solution, shown on [this](www.google.com) flowchart.


```python
import numpy as np
import time

def solution_2(n):
    start = time.time()
    
    series = [1, 2]
    a3 = series[-1] + series[-2]

    while (a3 < n):
        a3 = series[-1] + series[-2]
        series.append(a3)

    evens = [series[x] for x in range(1,len(series), 3)]
    elapsed = time.time() - start
    print(np.sum(evens), elapsed)
    
    return

solution_2(4000000)
```

### Comparison of the methods

Let's check which solution has the best performance:


```python
solution_1(4000000)
solution_2(4000000)
```

    4613732 6.198883056640625e-06
    4613732 2.193450927734375e-05


It seems like they both have the same performance. That's fair.
