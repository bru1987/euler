## Problem #5

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is **evenly divisible** by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

### Solution #1


```python
import math

# let's setthe floor first
def primes_up_to(n):
    product = 2

    for candidate_for_prime in range (3,n+1):
        for i in range (2,candidate_for_prime):
            if (candidate_for_prime % i == 0):
                break
            elif ((candidate_for_prime % i != 0) & (i + 1 == candidate_for_prime)):
                product *= candidate_for_prime

    return product

divisible_up_to = 20
floor = primes_up_to(divisible_up_to)

# the highest we can go is to n! (n factorial)
ceiling = math.factorial(divisible_up_to)

found = False

for ii in range (floor,ceiling):
    for i in range(2,divisible_up_to+1):
        if ii % i != 0:
            break
        elif i == divisible_up_to:
            print (ii)
            found = True
            break

    if found:
        break

```
